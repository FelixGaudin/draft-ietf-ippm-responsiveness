<t>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called
lag, latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized
as an unfortunate, but common, symptom in today’s networks.
Even after a decade of work on standardizing technical solutions,
it remains a common problem for the end users.</t>

<t>Everyone “knows” that it is “normal” for a video conference to
have problems when somebody else at home is
watching a 4K movie or uploading photos from their phone.
However, there is no technical reason for this to be the case.
In fact, various queue management solutions (fq_codel, cake, PIE)
have solved the problem.</t>

<t>Our networks remain unresponsive, not from a lack of technical solutions,
but rather a lack of awareness of the problem and its solutions.
We believe that creating a tool whose measurement matches people’s
everyday experience will create the necessary awareness,
and result in a demand for products that solve the problem.</t>

<t>This document specifies the “RPM Test” for measuring responsiveness.
It uses common protocols and mechanisms to measure user
experience specifically when the network is under working conditions.
The measurement is expressed as “Round-trips Per Minute” (RPM)
and should be included with throughput (up and down) and
idle latency as critical indicators of network quality.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called
lag, latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized
as an unfortunate, but common, symptom in today’s networks <xref target="Bufferbloat"/>.
Solutions like fq_codel <xref target="RFC8290"/> or PIE <xref target="RFC8033"/> have been standardized
and are to some extent widely implemented.
Nevertheless, people still suffer from bufferbloat.</t>

<t>Although significant, the impact on user experience can be transitory –
that is, its effect is not always visible to the user.
Whenever a network is actively being used at its full capacity,
buffers can fill up and create latency for traffic.
The duration of those full buffers may be brief:
a medium-sized file transfer, like an email attachment
or uploading photos,
can create bursts of latency spikes.
An example of this is lag occurring during a videoconference,
where a connection is briefly shown as unstable.</t>

<t>These short-lived disruptions make it hard to narrow down the cause.
We believe that it is necessary to create a standardized way to
measure and express responsiveness.</t>

<t>Existing network measurement tools could incorporate a
responsiveness measurement into their set of metrics.
Doing so would also raise the awareness of the problem and
would help establish a new expectation
that the standard measures of network quality should
– in addition to throughput and idle latency –
also include latency under load, or, as we prefer to call it,
responsiveness under working conditions.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>A word about the term “bufferbloat” – the undesirable latency
that comes from a router or other network equipment
buffering too much data.
This document uses the term as a general description of bad latency,
using more precise wording where warranted.</t>

<t>“Latency” is a poor measure of responsiveness,
since it can be hard for the general public to understand.
The units are unfamiliar (“what is a millisecond?”) and
counterintuitive (“100 msec – that sounds good –
it’s only a tenth of a second!”).</t>

<t>Instead, we create the term “Responsiveness under working conditions”
to make it clear that we are measuring all, not just idle, conditions,
and use “round-trips per minute” as the metric.
The advantage of round-trips per minute are two-fold: First, it allows for a metric
that is “the higher the better”. This kind of metric is often more intuitive for end-users.
Second, the range of the values tends to be around the 4-digit integer range which
is also a value easy to compare and read, again allowing for a more intuitive use.
Finally, we abbreviate the measurement to “RPM”, a wink to the
“revolutions per minute” that we use for car engines.</t>

<t>This document defines an algorithm for the “RPM Test”
that explicitly measures responsiveness under working conditions.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="design-constraints" title="Design Constraints">

<t>There are many challenges around measurements on the Internet.
They include the dynamic nature of the Internet,
the diverse nature of the traffic,
the large number of devices that affect traffic,
and the difficulty of attaining appropriate measurement conditions.</t>

<t>Internet paths are changing all the time.
Daily fluctuations in the demand make the bottlenecks ebb and flow.
To minimize the variability of routing changes,
it’s best to keep the test duration relatively short.</t>

<t>TCP and UDP traffic, or traffic on ports 80 and 443, may take
significantly different paths on the Internet and
be subject to entirely different Quality of Service (QoS) treatment.
A good test will use standard transport-layer traffic – typical
for people’s use of the network –
that is subject to the transport’s congestion control that might
reduce the traffic’s rate and thus its buffering in the network.</t>

<t>Traditionally, one thinks of bufferbloat happening on the
routers and switches of the Internet.
However, the networking stacks of the clients and servers can
have huge buffers.
Data sitting in TCP sockets or waiting for the application
to send or read causes artificial latency, and affects user experience
the same way as “traditional” bufferbloat.</t>

<t>Finally, it is crucial to recognize that significant
queueing only happens on entry to the lowest-capacity
(or “bottleneck”) hop on a network path.
For any flow of data between two communicating devices,
there is always one hop along the path where the capacity
available to that flow at that hop is the lowest among
all the hops of that flow’s path at that moment in time.
It is important to understand that the existence of a
lowest-capacity hop on a network path is not itself a problem.
In a heterogeneous network like the Internet it is
inevitable that there must necessarily be some hop
along the path with the lowest capacity for that path.
If that hop were to be improved to make it no longer
the lowest-capacity hop, then some other hop would
become the new lowest-capacity hop for that path.
In this context a “bottleneck” should not be seen as a problem to
be fixed, because any attempt to “fix” the bottleneck is futile –
such a “fix” can never remove the existence of a bottleneck
on a path; it just moves the bottleneck somewhere else.
Arguably, this heterogeneity of the Internet is one of its greatest strengths.
Allowing individual technologies to evolve and improve at their
own pace, without requiring the entire Internet to change in
lock-step, has enabled enormous improvements over the years
in technologies like DSL, cable modems, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi,
each advancing independently as new developments became ready.
As a result of this flexibility we have moved incrementally,
one step at a time, from 56kb/s dial-up modems in the 1990s to
Gb/s home Internet service and Gb/s wireless connectivity today.</t>

<t>Note that in a shared datagram network, conditions do not remain static.
The hop that is the current bottleneck may change from moment to moment.
For example, changes in other traffic may result in changes
to a flow’s share of a given hop. A user moving around
may cause the Wi-Fi transmission rate to vary widely,
from a few Mb/s when far from the Access Point,
all the way up to Gb/s or more when close to the Access Point.</t>

<t>Consequently, if we wish to enjoy the benefits of the Internet’s great
flexibility, we need software that embraces and celebrates this
diversity and adapts intelligently to the varying conditions it encounters.</t>

<t>Because significant queueing only happens on entry to the bottleneck
hop, the queue management at this critical hop of the path almost
entirely determines the responsiveness of the entire flow.
If the bottleneck hop’s queue management algorithm allows an
excessively large queue to form, this results in excessively large
delays for packets sitting in that queue awaiting transmission,
significantly degrading overall user experience.</t>

<t>In order to discover the depth of the buffer at the bottleneck hop,
the RPM Test mimics normal network operations and data transfers,
to cause this bottleneck buffer to fill to capacity, and then
measures the resulting end-to-end latency under these operating conditions.
A well managed bottleneck queue keeps its queue occupancy
under control, resulting in consistently low round-trip time
and consistently good responsiveness.
A poorly managed bottleneck queue will not.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goals" title="Goals">

<t>The algorithm described here defines an RPM Test that serves as a good
proxy for user experience. This means:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Today’s Internet traffic primarily uses HTTP/2 over TLS.
Thus, the algorithm should use that protocol.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
As a side note: other types of traffic are gaining in popularity (HTTP/3)
and/or are already being used widely (RTP).
Traffic prioritization and QoS rules on the Internet may
subject traffic to completely different paths:
these could also be measured separately.</t>
  <t>The Internet is marked by the deployment of countless middleboxes like
transparent TCP proxies or traffic prioritization for certain types of traffic.
The RPM Test must take into account their effect on
TCP-handshake <xref target="RFC0793"/>, TLS-handshake, and request/response.</t>
  <t>The test result should be expressed in an intuitive, nontechnical form.</t>
  <t>Finally, to be useful to a wide audience, the measurement
should finish within a short time frame.
Our target is 20 seconds.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="measuring-responsiveness-under-working-conditions" title="Measuring Responsiveness Under Working Conditions">

<t>To make an accurate measurement,
the algorithm must reliably put the network in a state
that represents those “working conditions”.
During this process, the algorithm measures the responsiveness of the network.
The following explains how
the former and the latter are achieved.</t>

<section anchor="working-conditions" title="Working Conditions">

<t>There are many different ways to define the state of “working conditions” to
measure responsiveness. There is no one true answer to this question. It is a
tradeoff between using realistic traffic patterns and pushing the network to
its limits.</t>

<t>In this document we aim to generate a realistic traffic pattern by
using standard HTTP transactions but exploring the worst-case scenario by creating
multiple of these transactions and using very large data objects in these HTTP
transactions.</t>

<t>This allows to create a stable state of working conditions during which the
network is used at its nearly full capacity, without generating DoS-like traffic
patterns (e.g., intentional UDP flooding). This creates a realistic traffic mix
representative of what a typical user’s network experiences in normal operation.</t>

<t>Finally, as end-user usage of the network evolves to newer protocols and congestion
control algorithms, it is important that the working conditions also can evolve
to continuously represent a realistic traffic pattern.</t>

<section anchor="from-single-flow-to-multi-flow" title="From single-flow to multi-flow">

<t>A single TCP connection may not be sufficient
to reach the capacity of a path quickly.
Using a 4MB receive window, over a network with a 32 ms round-trip time,
a single TCP connection can achieve up to 1Gb/s throughput.
For higher throughput and/or networks with higher round-trip time,
TCP allows larger receive window sizes, up to 1 GB.
For most applications there is little reason to open multiple
parallel TCP connections in an attempt to achieve higher throughput.</t>

<t>However, it may take some time for a single TCP connection to ramp
up to full speed, and one of the goals of the RPM test is to quickly
load the network to capacity, take its measurements, and then finish.
Additionally, traditional loss-based TCP congestion control algorithms
react aggressively to packet loss by reducing the congestion window.
This reaction (intended by the protocol design) decreases the
queueing within the network, making it harder to determine the
depth of the bottleneck queue reliably.</t>

<t>The purpose of the RPM Test is not to productively move data
across the network in a useful way, the way a normal application does.
The purpose of the RPM Test is, as quickly as possible, to simulate
a representative traffic load as if real applications were doing
sustained data transfers, measure the resulting round-trip time
occurring under those realistic conditions, and then end the test.
Because of this, using multiple simultaneous parallel connections
allows the RPM test to complete its task more quickly, in a way that
overall is less disruptive and less wasteful of network capacity
than a test using a single TCP connection that would take longer
to bring the bottleneck hop to a stable saturated state.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="parallel-vs-sequential-uplink-and-downlink" title="Parallel vs Sequential Uplink and Downlink">

<t>Poor responsiveness can be caused by queues in either (or both)
the upstream and the downstream direction.
Furthermore, both paths may differ significantly due to access link
conditions (e.g., 5G downstream and LTE upstream) or the routing changes
within the ISPs.
To measure responsiveness under working conditions,
the algorithm must explore both directions.</t>

<t>One approach could be to measure responsiveness in the uplink and downlink
in parallel. It would allow for a shorter test run-time.</t>

<t>However, a number of caveats come with measuring in parallel:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Half-duplex links may not permit simultaneous uplink and downlink traffic.
This means the test might not reach the path’s capacity in both directions at once and thus not expose
all the potential sources of low responsiveness.</t>
  <t>Debuggability of the results becomes harder:
During parallel measurement it is impossible to differentiate whether
the observed latency happens in the uplink or the downlink direction.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Thus, we recommend testing uplink and downlink sequentially. Parallel testing
is considered a future extension.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="reaching-full-link-utilization" title="Reaching full link utilization">

<t>The RPM Test gradually increases the number of TCP connections
and measures “goodput” – the sum of actual data transferred
across all connections in a unit of time.
When the goodput stops increasing, it means that the network is used at its full capacity.
At this point we are creating the worst-case scenario within the limits of the
realistic traffic pattern.</t>

<t>The algorithm notes that throughput increases rapidly until TCP
connections complete their TCP slow-start phase.
At that point, throughput eventually stalls,
often due to receive window limitations, particularly in cases of
high network bandwidth, high network round-trip time,
low receive window size, or a combination of all three.
The only means to further increase throughput is by
adding more TCP connections to the pool of load-generating connections.
If new connections leave the throughput the same,
full link utilization has been reached and – more importantly –
the working condition is stable.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="final-working-conditions-algorithm" title="Final “Working Conditions” Algorithm">

<t>The following algorithm reaches working conditions of a network
by using HTTP/2 upload (POST) or download (GET) requests of infinitely large
files.
The algorithm is the same for upload and download and uses
the same term “load-generating connection” for each.
The actions of the algorithm take place at regular intervals. For the current draft
the interval is defined as one second.</t>

<t>Where</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>i: The index of the current interval. The variable i is initialized to 0 when the algorithm begins and
increases by one for each interval.</t>
  <t>instantaneous aggregate goodput at interval p: The number of total bytes of data transferred within
interval p, divided by the interval duration.
If p is negative (i.e., a time interval logically prior to the start of the test beginning,
used in moving average calculations),
the number of total bytes of data transferred within that
interval is considered to be 0.</t>
  <t>moving average aggregate goodput at interval p: The number of total bytes of data transferred within
interval p and the three immediately preceding intervals, divided by four times the interval duration.</t>
  <t>moving average stability during the period between intervals b and e:
Whether or not, for all b≤x&lt;e, the absolute difference is less than 5% between
the moving average aggregate goodput at interval x and
the moving average aggregate goodput at interval x+1.
If all absolute differences are below 5% then the moving average has achieved stability.
If any of the absolute differences are 5% or more then the moving average has not achieved stability.</t>
</list></t>

<t>the steps of the algorithm are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Create four load-generating connections.</t>
  <t>At each interval:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Compute the instantaneous aggregate goodput at interval i.</t>
      <t>Compute the moving average aggregate goodput at interval i.</t>
      <t>If the moving average aggregate goodput at interval i is more than a 5% increase over
the moving average aggregate goodput at interval i - 1, the network has not yet reached full link utilization.
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>If no load-generating connections have been added within the last four intervals, add four more load-generating connections.</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>Else, the network has reached full link utilization with the existing load-generating connections. The current state is a candidate for stable working conditions.
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>If a) there have been load-generating connections added in the past four intervals and b) there has been moving average stability during the period between intervals i-4 and i,
then the network has reached full link utilization and the algorithm terminates.</t>
          <t>Otherwise, add four more load-generating connections.</t>
        </list></t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>In <xref target="goals"/>, it is mentioned that one of the goals is that the test finishes within
20 seconds. It is left to the implementation what to do when full link utilization is not reached
within that time-frame. For example, an implementation might gather a provisional
responsiveness measurement or let the test run for longer.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="measuring-responsiveness" title="Measuring Responsiveness">

<t>Measuring responsiveness during the previously explained working conditions creation
is a continuous process during the duration of the test. It requires a sufficiently
large sample-size to have confidence in the results.</t>

<t>The measurement of the responsiveness happens by sending probe-requests for a small
object. There are two types of probe requests:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>A HTTP GET request on a separate connection (“foreign probes”).
This test mimics the time it takes for a web browser to connect to a new
web server and request the first element of a web page (e.g., “index.html”),
or the startup time for a video streaming client to launch and begin fetching media.</t>
  <t>A HTTP GET request multiplexed on the load-generating connections (“self probes”).
This test mimics the time it takes for a video streaming client
to skip ahead to a different chapter in the same video stream,
or for a navigation client to react and fetch new map tiles
when the user scrolls the map to view a different area.
In a well functioning system fetching new data
over an existing connection should take less time than
creating a brand new TLS connection from scratch to do the same thing.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Foreign probes will provide 3 sets of data-points. First, the duration of the TCP-handshake
(noted hereafter as tcp_foreign).
Second, the TLS round-trip-time (noted tls_foreign). For this, it is important to note that different TLS versions
have a different number of round-trips. Thus, the TLS establishment time needs to be
normalized to the number of round-trips the TLS handshake takes until the connection
is ready to transmit data. And third, the HTTP elapsed time between issuing the GET
request for a 1-byte object and receiving the entire response (noted http_foreign).</t>

<t>Self probes will provide a single data-point for the duration between of time between
when the HTTP GET request for the 1-byte object is issued on the load-generating connection and the
full HTTP response has been received (noted http_self).</t>

<t>tcp_foreign, tls_foreign, http_foreign and http_self are all measured in milliseconds.</t>

<t>The more probes that are sent, the more data is available for calculation. In order to generate
as much data as possible, the methodology requires a client to issue these probes every 100ms.
For the probes on the load-generating connections, the client needs to use one of the
initial load-generating connections.
This means that every 100ms, 2 probes are being evaluated. The total amount of data
used for these probes would be no more than about 50KB worth of data within one second.</t>

<section anchor="aggregating-the-measurements" title="Aggregating the Measurements">

<t>The algorithm produces sets of 4 times for each probe, namely:
tcp_foreign, tls_foreign, http_foreign, http_self (from the previous section). Each of these sets
will have a large number of samples. Use the following methodology to calculate a single RPM value
from these data:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Among each set, take the 90th percentile, thus resulting in 4 individual numbers (tcp_foreign_p90, tls_foreign_p90, http_foreign_p90, http_self_p90).</t>
  <t>Calculate the RPM as the weighted mean:</t>

<t>This responsiveness value presents round-trips per minute (RPM).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="interpreting-responsiveness-results" title="Interpreting responsiveness results">

<t>The described methodology uses a high-level approach to measure responsiveness.
By executing the test with regular HTTP requests a number of elements come into
play that will influence the result. Contrary to more traditional measurement methods
the responsiveness metric is not only influenced by the properties of the
network but can significantly be influenced by the properties of the client
and the server implementations. This section describes how the different
elements influence responsiveness and how a user may differentiate them
when debugging a network.</t>

<section anchor="elements-influencing-responsiveness" title="Elements influencing responsiveness">

<t>Due to the HTTP-centric approach of the measurement methodology a number of
factors come into play that influence the results. Namely, the client-side
networking stack (from the top of the HTTP-layer all the way down to the physical layer),
the network (including potential transparent HTTP “accelerators”), and the server-side
networking stack. The following outlines how each of these contributes to the responsiveness.</t>

<section anchor="client-side-influence" title="Client side influence">

<t>As the driver of the measurement, the client-side networking stack can have a
large influence on the result. The biggest influence of the client comes
when measuring the responsiveness in the uplink direction. Load-generation will
cause queue-buildup in the transport layer as well as the HTTP layer. Additionally,
if the network’s bottleneck is on the first hop, queue-buildup will happen at the
layers below the transport stack (e.g., NIC firmware).</t>

<t>Each of these queue build-ups may cause latency and thus low responsiveness.
A well designed networking stack would ensure that queue-buildup in the TCP layer
is kept at a bare minimum with solutions like TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT <xref target="draft-ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"/>.
At the HTTP/2 layer it is important that the load-generating data is not interfering
with the latency-measuring probes. For example, the different streams should not
be stacked one after the other but rather be allowed to be multiplexed for
optimal latency. The queue-buildup at these layers would only influence latency
on the probes that are sent on the load-generating connections.</t>

<t>Below the transport layer many places have a potential queue build-up. It is
important to keep these queues at reasonable sizes or that they implement techniques
like FQ-Codel. Depending on the techniques used at these layers, the queue build-up
can influence latency on probes sent on load-generating connections as well as
separate connections. If flow-queuing is used at these layers, the impact on
separate connections will be negligible.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="network-influence" title="Network influence">

<t>The network obviously is a large driver for the responsiveness result.
Propagation delay from the client to the server as well as queuing in the
bottleneck node will cause latency. Beyond these traditional sources of latency,
other factors may influence the results as well. Many networks deploy transparent
TCP Proxies, firewalls doing deep packet-inspection, HTTP “accelerators”,…
As the methodology relies on the use of HTTP/2, the responsiveness metric will
be influenced by such devices as well.</t>

<t>The network will influence both kinds of latency probes that the responsiveness
tests sends out. Depending on the network’s use of Smart Queue Management and whether
this includes flow-queuing or not, the latency probes on the load-generating
connections may be influenced differently than the probes on the separate
connections.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="server-side-influence" title="Server side influence">

<t>Finally, the server-side introduces the same kind of influence on the responsiveness
as the client-side, with the difference that the responsiveness will be impacted
during the downlink load generation.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="root-causing-responsiveness" title="Root-causing Responsiveness">

<t>Once an RPM result has been generated one might be tempted to try to localize
the source of a potential low responsiveness. The responsiveness measurement
is however aimed at providing a quick, top-level view of the responsiveness
under working conditions the way end-users experience it.
Localizing the source of low responsiveness involves however a set of different
tools and methodologies.</t>

<t>Nevertheless, the responsiveness test allows to gain some insight into what the
source of the latency is. The previous section described the elements that influence
the responsiveness. From there it became apparent that the latency measured
on the load-generating connections and the latency measured on separate connections
may be different due to the different elements.</t>

<t>For example, if the latency measured on separate connections is much less than the
latency measured on the load-generating connections, it is possible to narrow
down the source of the additional latency on the load-generating connections.
As long as the other elements of the network don’t do flow-queueing, the additional
latency must come from the queue build-up at the HTTP and TCP layer.
This is because all other bottlenecks in the network that may cause a queue build-up
will be affecting the load-generating connections as well as the separate latency
probing connections in the same way.</t>

On top of this foundation, a minimal amount of new “protocol” is defined,
merely specifying the URLs that used for GET and PUT in the process of
executing the test.</t>

<t>Both the client and the server MUST support HTTP/2 over TLS.
The client MUST be able to send a GET request and a POST.
The server MUST be able to respond to both of these
HTTP commands.
The server MUST have the ability to provide content upon a GET request.
Both client and server SHOULD use loss-based congestion controls
like Cubic.
The server MUST use a packet scheduling algorithm that minimizes internal queueing
to avoid affecting the client’s measurement.</t>

<t>The server MUST respond to 4 URLs:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>A “small” URL/response:
The server must respond with a status code of 200 and 1 byte in the body.
The actual message content is irrelevant.
The server SHOULD specify the content-type as application/octet-stream.
The server SHOULD minimize the size, in bytes, of the response fields that are encoded and sent on the wire.</t>
  <t>A “large” URL/response:
The server must respond with a status code of 200 and a body size of at least 8GB.
The server SHOULD specify the content-type as application/octet-stream.
The body can be bigger, and may need to grow as network speeds increases over time.
The actual message content is irrelevant.
The client will probably never completely download the object,
but will instead close the connection after reaching working condition
and making its measurements.</t>
  <t>An “upload” URL/response:
The server must handle a POST request with an arbitrary body size.
The server should discard the payload.
The actual POST message content is irrelevant.
The client will probably never completely upload the object,
but will instead close the connection after reaching working condition
and making its measurements.</t>
  <t>A configuration URL that returns a JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> object with the information
the client uses to run the test (sample below). The server SHOULD specify the
content-type as application/json.
Sample JSON:</t>
</list></t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{
  "version": 1,
  "urls": {
    "large_https_download_url":"https://nq.example.com/api/v1/large",
    "small_https_download_url":"https://nq.example.com/api/v1/small",
    "https_upload_url":        "https://nq.example.com/api/v1/upload"
  }
  "test_endpoint": "hostname123.provider.com"
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>All of the fields in the sample configuration are required except “test_endpoint”.
If the test server provider can pin all of the requests for a test run to a specific
host in the service (for a particular run), they can specify that host name in the
“test_endpoint” field.</t>

<t>The client begins the responsiveness measurement by querying for the JSON configuration.
This supplies the URLs for creating the load-generating connections in
the upstream and downstream direction as well as the small object
for the latency measurements.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="rpm-test-server-discovery" title="RPM Test Server Discovery">

<t>It makes sense to host RPM Test Server instances in Internet
Data Centers where they can be accessed easily by users
wishing to test the quality of their Internet connection.
However, when a user performs an RPM test and determines
that they are suffering from poor RPM during download,
the logical next question might be,
“What’s causing my poor performance?
Is it poor buffer management by my ISP?
Is it poor buffer management in my home Wi-Fi Access point?
Something else?”</t>

<t>To help an end user answer this question, it will be useful for home gateway
equipment to host RPM Test Server instances.
In an example configuration, a user may have cable modem
service offering 100 Mb/s download speed, connected via
gigabit Ethernet to one or more Wi-Fi access points in the home,
which then offer service to Wi-Fi client devices at different rates
depending on distance, interference from other traffic, etc.
By having the cable modem itself host an RPM Test Server instance,
the user can then run a test between the cable modem and their computer
or smartphone, to help isolate whether bufferbloat they are experiencing
is occurring in equipment inside the home (like their Wi-Fi access points)
or somewhere outside the home.</t>

<t>To aid in discoverability of these facilities,
local RPM Test Server instances SHOULD advertise the availability
of service type <xref target="RFC6335"/> “_nq._tcp” (Network Quality),
via DNS-Based Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763"/>,
using Multicast DNS on its local link(s) <xref target="RFC6762"/>.
Where applicable, an RPM Test Server instance SHOULD also advertise
the availability of its service via unicast discovery,
for discovery by client devices not directly attached to the same link.
Population of the appropriate DNS zone with the
relevant unicast discovery records can be performed
automatically using a Discovery Proxy <xref target="RFC8766"/>,
or in some scenarios simply by having a human
administrator manually enter the required records.
Similarly, a “cloud” service, providing Internet hosting service for
“example.com” could choose to include the relevant DNS-SD records
within the “example.com” domain <xref target="RFC6763"/> to communicate
to clients the list of available RPM Test Server instances.</t>

<abstract><t>As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important.  In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful.</t><t>Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server.  In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names.</t><t>The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation.  As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance.  There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.</t><t>This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called &quot;PIE&quot; (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations.  The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.</t></abstract>
