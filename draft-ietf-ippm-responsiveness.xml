<t>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called
lag, latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized
as an unfortunate, but common, symptom in today's networks.
Even after a decade of work on standardizing technical solutions,
it remains a common problem for the end users.</t>

<t>Everyone "knows" that it is "normal" for a video conference to
have problems when somebody else at home is
watching a 4K movie or uploading photos from their phone.
However, there is no technical reason for this to be the case.
In fact, various queue management solutions (fq_codel, cake, PIE)
have solved the problem.</t>

<t>Our networks remain unresponsive, not from a lack of technical solutions,
but rather a lack of awareness of the problem and deployment of its solutions.
We believe that creating a tool that measures the problem and matches people's
everyday experience will create the necessary awareness,
and result in a demand for solutions.</t>

<t>This document specifies the "Responsiveness Test" for measuring responsiveness.
It uses common protocols and mechanisms to measure user

idle latency as critical indicators of network quality.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called
lag, latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized
as an unfortunate, but common, symptom in today's networks <xref target="Bufferbloat"/>.
Solutions like fq_codel <xref target="RFC8290"/> or PIE <xref target="RFC8033"/> have been standardized
and are to some extent widely implemented.
Nevertheless, people still suffer from bufferbloat.</t>

<t>Although significant, the impact on user experience can be transitory --
that is, its effect is not always visible to the user.
Whenever a network is actively being used at its full capacity,
buffers can fill up and create latency for traffic.
The duration of those full buffers may be brief:
a medium-sized file transfer, like an email attachment
or uploading photos,
can create bursts of latency spikes.
An example of this is lag occurring during a videoconference,
where a connection is briefly shown as unstable.</t>

<t>These short-lived disruptions make it hard to narrow down the cause.
We believe that it is necessary to create a standardized way to
measure and express responsiveness.</t>

<t>Including the responsiveness-under-working-conditions test
among other measurements of network quality (e.g., throughput
and idle latency) would raise awareness of the problem and
establish the expectation among users that their network providers deploy
solutions.</t>

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology</name>

<t>A word about the term "bufferbloat" -- the undesirable latency
that comes from a router or other network equipment
buffering too much data.
This document uses the term as a general description of bad latency,
using more precise wording where warranted.</t>

<t>"Latency" is a poor measure of responsiveness,
because it can be hard for the general public to understand.
The units are unfamiliar ("what is a millisecond?") and
counterintuitive ("100 msec -- that sounds good --
it's only a tenth of a second!").</t>

<t>Instead, we define the term "responsiveness under working conditions"
to make it clear that we are measuring all, not just idle, conditions,
and use "round-trips per minute" as the unit.
The advantage of using round-trips per minute as the unit are two-fold: First, it allows for a unit
that is "the higher the better". This kind of unit is often more intuitive for end-users.
Second, the range of the values tends to be around the 4-digit integer range which
is also a value easy to compare and read, again allowing for a more intuitive use.
Finally, we abbreviate the unit to "RPM", a wink to the
"revolutions per minute" that we use for car engines.</t>

<t>This document defines an algorithm for the "Responsiveness Test"
that explicitly measures responsiveness under working conditions.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="design-constraints"><name>Design Constraints</name>

<t>There are many challenges to defining measurements of the Internet:
the dynamic nature of the Internet,
the diverse nature of the traffic,
the large number of devices that affect traffic,
the difficulty of attaining appropriate measurement conditions,
diurnal traffic patterns,
and changing routes.</t>

<t>In order to minimize the effects of these challenges, 
it's best to keep the test duration relatively short.</t>

<t>TCP and UDP traffic, or traffic on ports 80 and 443, may take
significantly different paths over the network between source and destination
and be subject to entirely different Quality of Service (QoS) treatment.
A good test will use standard transport-layer traffic -- typical
for people's use of the network --
that is subject to the transport layer's congestion control algorithms 
that might reduce the traffic's rate and thus its buffering in the network.</t>

<t>Traditionally, one thinks of bufferbloat happening in the network, i.e., on
routers and switches of the Internet.
However, the networking stacks of the clients and servers can
have huge buffers.
Data sitting in TCP sockets or waiting for the application
to send or read causes artificial latency, and affects user experience
the same way as in-network bufferbloat.</t>

<t>Finally, it is crucial to recognize that significant
queueing only happens on entry to the lowest-capacity
(or “bottleneck”) hop on a network path.
For any flow of data between two endpoints
there is always one hop along the path where the capacity
available to that flow at that hop is the lowest among
all the hops of that flow’s path at that moment in time.
It is important to understand that the existence of a
lowest-capacity hop on a network path and a buffer to smooth bursts
of data is not itself a problem.
In a heterogeneous network like the Internet it is
inevitable that there must necessarily be some hop
along the path with the lowest capacity for that path.
If that hop were to be improved, then some other hop would
become the new lowest-capacity hop for that path.
In this context a “bottleneck” should not be seen as a problem to
be fixed, because any attempt to “fix” the bottleneck is futile --
such a “fix” can never remove the existence of a bottleneck
on a path; it just moves the bottleneck somewhere else.
Arguably, this heterogeneity of the Internet is one of its greatest strengths.
Allowing individual technologies to evolve and improve at their
own pace, without requiring the entire Internet to change in
lock-step, has enabled enormous improvements over the years
in technologies like DSL, cable modems, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi,
each advancing independently as new developments became ready.
As a result of this flexibility we have moved incrementally,
one step at a time, from 56kb/s dial-up modems in the 1990s to
Gb/s home Internet service and Gb/s wireless connectivity today.</t>

<t>Note that in a shared datagram network, conditions do not remain static.
The hop that is the current bottleneck may change from moment to moment.
For example, changes in simultaneous traffic may result in changes
to a flow’s share of a given hop. A user moving around
may cause the Wi-Fi transmission rate to vary widely,
from a few Mb/s when far from the Access Point,
all the way up to Gb/s or more when close to the Access Point.</t>

<t>Consequently, if we wish to enjoy the benefits of the Internet’s great
flexibility, we need software that embraces and celebrates this
diversity and adapts intelligently to the varying conditions it encounters.</t>

<t>Because significant queueing only happens on entry to the bottleneck
hop, the queue management at this critical hop of the path almost
entirely determines the responsiveness of the entire flow.
If the bottleneck hop’s queue management algorithm allows an
excessively large queue to form, this results in excessively large
delays for packets sitting in that queue awaiting transmission,
significantly degrading overall user experience.</t>

<t>In order to discover the depth of the buffer at the bottleneck hop,
the proposed Responsiveness Test mimics normal network operations and data transfers,
with the goal of filling the bottleneck buffer to capacity, and then
measures the resulting end-to-end latency under these so-called working conditions.
A well-managed bottleneck queue keeps its occupancy
under control, resulting in consistently low round-trip times
and consistently good responsiveness.
A poorly managed bottleneck queue will not.</t>

<section anchor="goals"><name>Goals</name>

<t>The algorithm described here defines a Responsiveness Test that serves as a good
proxy for user experience. Therefore:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Because today's Internet traffic primarily uses HTTP/2 over TLS, the test's
algorithm should use that protocol.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
As a side note: other types of traffic are gaining in popularity (HTTP/3)
and/or are already being used widely (RTP).
Traffic prioritization and QoS rules on the Internet may
subject traffic to completely different paths:
these could also be measured separately.</t>
  <t>Because the Internet is marked by the deployment of countless middleboxes like
transparent TCP proxies or traffic prioritization for certain types of traffic,
the Responsiveness Test algorithm must take into account their effect on
TCP-handshake <xref target="RFC0793"/>, TLS-handshake, and request/response.</t>
  <t>Because the goal of the test is to educate end users, the results should be expressed in an intuitive, nontechnical form
and not commit the user to spend a significant amount of their time (we target 20 seconds).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="measuring-responsiveness-under-working-conditions"><name>Measuring Responsiveness Under Working Conditions</name>

<t>Overall, the test to measure responsiveness under working conditions proceeds in two steps:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Put the network connection into "working conditions"</t>
  <t>Measure responsiveness of the network.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following explains how the former and the latter are achieved.</t>

<section anchor="working-conditions"><name>Working Conditions</name>

<t>What are <em>the</em> conditions that best emulate how a network
connection is used? There is no one true answer to this question. It is a
tradeoff between using realistic traffic patterns and pushing the network to
its limits.</t>

<t>The Responsiveness Test defines working conditions as the condition where the path between the
measuring endpoints is utilized at its end-to-end capacity and the queue at the bottleneck link
is at (or beyond) its maximum occupancy. Under these conditions, the network connection's responsiveness
will be at its worst.</t>

<t>The Responsiveness Test algorithm for reaching working conditions combines 
multiple standard HTTP transactions with very large data objects according to realistic traffic patterns
to create these conditions.</t>

<t>This allows to create a stable state of working conditions during which the
bottleneck of the path between client and server has its buffer filled
up entirely, without generating DoS-like traffic
patterns (e.g., intentional UDP flooding). This creates a realistic traffic mix
representative of what a typical user’s network experiences in normal operation.</t>

<t>Finally, as end-user usage of the network evolves to newer protocols and congestion
control algorithms, it is important that the working conditions also can evolve
to continuously represent a realistic traffic pattern.</t>

<section anchor="single-flow-vs-multi-flow"><name>Single-flow vs multi-flow</name>

<t>A single TCP connection may not be sufficient
to reach the capacity and full buffer occupancy of a path quickly.
Using a 4MB receive window, over a network with a 32 ms round-trip time,
a single TCP connection can achieve up to 1Gb/s throughput.
Additionally, deep buffers along the path between the two endpoints may be
significantly larger than 4MB.
TCP allows larger receive window sizes, up to 1GB. However, most transport stacks
aggressively limit the size of the receive window to avoid consuming too much
memory.</t>

<t>Thus, the only way to achieve full capacity and full buffer occupancy on those
networks is by creating multiple connections, allowing to actively fill the
bottleneck's buffer to achieve maximum working conditions.</t>

<t>Even if a single TCP connection would be able to fill the bottleneck's buffer,
it may take some time for a single TCP connection to ramp
up to full speed. One of the goals of the Responsiveness Test is to help the user 
quickly measure their network. As a result, the test must load the network, take its measurements, and then finish
as fast as possible.</t>

<t>Finally, traditional loss-based TCP congestion control algorithms
react aggressively to packet loss by reducing the congestion window.
This reaction (intended by the protocol design) decreases the
queueing within the network, making it harder to determine the
depth of the bottleneck queue reliably.</t>

<t>The purpose of the Responsiveness Test is not to productively move data
across the network in a useful way, the way a normal application does.
The purpose of the Responsiveness Test is, as quickly as possible, to simulate
a representative traffic load as if real applications were doing
sustained data transfers, measure the resulting round-trip time
occurring under those realistic conditions.
Because of this, using multiple simultaneous parallel connections
allows the Responsiveness Test to complete its task more quickly, in a way that
overall is less disruptive and less wasteful of network capacity
than a test using a single TCP connection that would take longer
to bring the bottleneck hop to a stable saturated state.</t>

<t>In this document, we impose an upper bound on the number of parallel load-generating
connections to 16.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="parallel-vs-sequential-uplink-and-downlink"><name>Parallel vs Sequential Uplink and Downlink</name>

<t>Poor responsiveness can be caused by queues in either (or both)
the upstream and the downstream direction.
Furthermore, both paths may differ significantly due to access link
conditions (e.g., 5G downstream and LTE upstream) or routing changes
within the ISPs.
To measure responsiveness under working conditions,
the algorithm must explore both directions.</t>

<t>One approach could be to measure responsiveness in the uplink and downlink
in parallel. It would allow for a shorter test run-time.</t>

<t>However, a number of caveats come with measuring in parallel:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Half-duplex links may not permit simultaneous uplink and downlink traffic.
This restriction means the test might not reach the path's capacity in both directions at once and thus not expose
all the potential sources of low responsiveness.</t>
  <t>Debuggability of the results becomes harder:
During parallel measurement it is impossible to differentiate whether
the observed latency happens in the uplink or the downlink direction.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Thus, we recommend testing uplink and downlink sequentially. Parallel testing
is considered a future extension.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="achieving-full-buffer-utilization"><name>Achieving Full Buffer Utilization</name>

<t>The Responsiveness Test gradually increases the number of TCP connections (known as load-generating connections)
and measures "goodput" (the sum of actual data transferred across all connections in a unit of time)
continuously.
By definition, once goodput is maximized, buffers will start filling up, creating the
"standing queue" that is characteristic of bufferbloat. At this moment the test starts
measuring the responsiveness until it, too, reaches saturation.
At this point we are creating the worst-case scenario within the limits of the
realistic traffic pattern.</t>

<t>The algorithm notes that throughput increases rapidly until TCP
connections complete their TCP slow-start phase.
At that point, throughput eventually stalls,
often due to receive window limitations, particularly in cases of
high network bandwidth, high network round-trip time,
low receive window size, or a combination of all three.
The only means to further increase throughput is by
adding more TCP connections to the pool of load-generating connections.
If new connections leave the throughput the same,
full link utilization has been reached and -- more importantly --
the working condition is stable.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="measuring-responsiveness"><name>Measuring Responsiveness</name>

<t>Measuring responsiveness while achieving working conditions is a process of continuous measurement.
It requires a sufficiently large sample-size to have confidence in the results.</t>

<t>The measurement of the responsiveness happens by sending probe-requests.
There are two types of probe requests:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>A HTTP GET request on a separate connection ("foreign probes").
This test mimics the time it takes for a web browser to connect to a new
web server and request the first element of a web page (e.g., “index.html”),
or the startup time for a video streaming client to launch and begin fetching media.</t>
  <t>A HTTP GET request multiplexed on the load-generating connections ("self probes").
This test mimics the time it takes for a video streaming client
to skip ahead to a different chapter in the same video stream,
or for a navigation client to react and fetch new map tiles
when the user scrolls the map to view a different area.
In a well functioning system fetching new data
over an existing connection should take less time than
creating a brand new TLS connection from scratch to do the same thing.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Foreign probes will provide 3 sets of data-points. First, the duration of the TCP-handshake
(noted hereafter as <spanx style="verb">tcp_f</spanx>).
Second, the TLS round-trip-time (noted <spanx style="verb">tls_f</spanx>). For this, it is important to note that different TLS versions
have a different number of round-trips. Thus, the TLS establishment time needs to be
normalized to the number of round-trips the TLS handshake takes until the connection
is ready to transmit data. And third, the HTTP elapsed time between issuing the GET
request for a 1-byte object and receiving the entire response (noted <spanx style="verb">http_f</spanx>).</t>

<t>Self probes will provide a single data-point for the duration of time between
when the HTTP GET request for the 1-byte object is issued on the load-generating connection and the
full HTTP response has been received (noted <spanx style="verb">http_s</spanx>).</t>

<t><spanx style="verb">tcp_f</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">tls_f</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">http_f</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">http_s</spanx> are all measured in milliseconds.</t>

<t>The more probes that are sent, the more data available for calculation. In order to generate
as much data as possible, the Responsiveness Test specifies that a client issue these probes regularly.
There is, however, a risk that on low-capacity networks the responsiveness probes
themselves will consume a significant amount of the capacity. Because the test mandates
first saturating capacity before probing for responsiveness, we are able to
accurately estimate how much of the capacity the responsiveness probes will consume and never
send more probes than the network can handle.</t>

<t>Limiting the data used by probes can be done by providing an estimate of the number of bytes exchanged for a
responsiveness probe. Taking TCP and TLS overheads into account, we can estimate
the amount of data exchanged for a probe on a foreign connection to be around 5000 bytes.
On load-generating connections we can expect an overhead of no more than 1000 bytes.</t>

<t>Given this information, we recommend that at each responsiveness probing interval does
not send more than MPS (Maximum responsiveness Probes per Second - default to 100) probes per second.
The probes should be spread out equally over the duration of the interval with an
equal split between foreign and different load-generating connections. For the probes on
load-generating connections, the connection should be selected randomly for each probe.</t>

<t>This would result in a total amount of data per second of 300 KB or 2400Kb, meaning
a total capacity utilization of 2400 Kbps for the probing.</t>

<t>On high-speed networks, this will provide a significant amount of samples, while at
the same time minimizing the probing overhead.
However, on severely capacity-constrained networks the probing traffic could consume
a significant portion of the available capacity. The Responsiveness Test must
adjust its probing frequency and in such a way that the probing traffic does not consume
more than PTC (Percentage of Total Capacity - default to 5%) of the available capacity.</t>

<section anchor="aggregating-the-measurements"><name>Aggregating the Measurements</name>

<t>The algorithm produces sets of 4 times for each probe, namely:
tcp_f, tls_f, http_f, http_l (from the previous section).
The responsiveness evolves over time as buffers gradually reach saturation. Once
the buffers are saturated responsiveness is stable over time. Thus, the aggregation
of the measurements considers the last MAD (Moving Average Distance - default to 4) intervals worth of completed responsiveness probes.</t>

<t>Over the timeframe of these intervals a potentially large number of samples has been collected.
These may be affected by noise in the measurements, and outliers. Thus, to aggregate these
we suggest to use a trimmed mean at the TMP (Trimmed Mean Percentage - default to 95%) percentile, thus providing the following numbers:
TM(tcp_f), TM(tls_f), TM(http_f), TM(http_l).</t>

<t>The responsiveness is then calculated as the weighted mean:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Responsiveness = 60000 /
(1/6*(TM(tcp_f) + TM(tls_f) + TM(http_f)) +
  1/2*TM(http_s))
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This responsiveness value presents round-trips per minute (RPM).</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="final-algorithm"><name>Final Algorithm</name>

<t>Considering the previous two sections, where we explain what the meaning of
working conditions is and the definition of responsiveness, we can design the
final algorithm. In order to measure the worst-case latency we need to transmit
traffic at the full capacity of the path as well as ensure the buffers are filled
to the maximum.
We can achieve this by continuously adding HTTP sessions to the pool of connections
in a ID (Interval duration - default to 1 second) interval. This will ensure that we quickly reach capacity and full
buffer occupancy. First, the algorithm reaches stability for the goodput. Once
goodput stability has been achieved, responsiveness probes are being transmitted
until responsiveness stability is reached.</t>

<t>We consider both, goodput and responsiveness to be stable, when the standard deviation
of the past MAD intervals is within SDT (Standard Deviation Tolerance - default to 5%) of the last of the moving averages.</t>

<t>The following algorithm reaches working conditions of a network
by using HTTP/2 upload (POST) or download (GET) requests of infinitely large
files.
The algorithm is the same for upload and download and uses
the same term "load-generating connection" for each.
The actions of the algorithm take place at regular intervals. For the current draft
the interval is defined as one second.</t>

<t>Where</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>i: The index of the current interval. The variable i is initialized to 0 when the algorithm begins and
increases by one for each interval.</t>
  <t>moving average aggregate goodput at interval p: The number of total bytes of data transferred within
interval p and the three immediately preceding intervals, divided by four times the interval duration.</t>
</list></t>

<t>the steps of the algorithm are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Create a load-generating connection.</t>
  <t>At each interval:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Create an additional load-generating connection.</t>
      <t>If goodput has not saturated:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Compute the moving average aggregate goodput at interval i as current_average.</t>
          <t>If the standard deviation of the past MAD average goodput values is less than SDT of the current_average, declare saturation and move on to probe responsiveness.</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>If goodput has saturated:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Compute the responsiveness at interval i as current_responsiveness.</t>
          <t>If the standard deviation of the past MAD responsiveness values is less than SDT of the current_responsiveness, declare saturation and report current_responsiveness.</t>
        </list></t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>In <xref target="goals"/>, it is mentioned that one of the goals is that the test finishes within
20 seconds. It is left to the implementation what to do when stability is not reached
within that time-frame. For example, an implementation might gather a provisional
responsiveness measurement or let the test run for longer.</t>

<t>Finally, if at any point one of these connections terminates with an error, the test should be aborted.</t>

<section anchor="confidence-of-test-results"><name>Confidence of test-results</name>

<t>As described above, a tool running the algorithm typically defines a time-limit for
the execution of each of the stages. For example, if the tool allocates a total
run-time of 40 seconds, and it executes a full downlink followed by a uplink test,
it may allocate 10 seconds to each of the saturation-stages (downlink capacity saturation, downlink responsiveness saturation, uplink capacity saturation, uplink responsiveness saturation).</t>

<t>As the different stages may or may not reach stability, we can define a "confidence score"
for the different metrics (capacity and responsiveness) the methodology was able to measure.</t>

<t>We define "Low" confidence in the result if the algorithm was not even able to
execute 4 iterations of the specific stage. Meaning, the moving average is
not taking the full window into account.</t>

<t>We define "Medium" confidence if the algorithm was able to execute at least 4
iterations, but did not reach stability based on standard deviation tolerance.</t>

<t>We define "High" confidence if the algorithm was able to fully reach stability
based on the define standard deviation tolerance.</t>

<section anchor="interpreting-responsiveness-results"><name>Interpreting responsiveness results</name>

<t>The described methodology uses a high-level approach to measure responsiveness.
By executing the test with regular HTTP requests a number of elements come into
play that will influence the result. Contrary to more traditional measurement methods
the responsiveness metric is not only influenced by the properties of the
network but can significantly be influenced by the properties of the client
and the server implementations. This section describes how the different
elements influence responsiveness and how a user may differentiate them
when debugging a network.</t>

<section anchor="elements-influencing-responsiveness"><name>Elements influencing responsiveness</name>

<t>Due to the HTTP-centric approach of the measurement methodology a number of
factors come into play that influence the results. Namely, the client-side
networking stack (from the top of the HTTP-layer all the way down to the physical layer),
the network (including potential transparent HTTP "accelerators"), and the server-side
networking stack. The following outlines how each of these contributes to the responsiveness.</t>

<section anchor="client-side-influence"><name>Client side influence</name>

<t>As the driver of the measurement, the client-side networking stack can have a
large influence on the result. The biggest influence of the client comes
when measuring the responsiveness in the uplink direction. Load-generation will
cause queue-buildup in the transport layer as well as the HTTP layer. Additionally,
if the network's bottleneck is on the first hop, queue-buildup will happen at the
layers below the transport stack (e.g., NIC firmware).</t>

<t>Each of these queue build-ups may cause latency and thus low responsiveness.
A well designed networking stack would ensure that queue-buildup in the TCP layer
is kept at a bare minimum with solutions like TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT <xref target="draft-ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"/>.
At the HTTP/2 layer it is important that the load-generating data is not interfering
with the latency-measuring probes. For example, the different streams should not
be stacked one after the other but rather be allowed to be multiplexed for
optimal latency. The queue-buildup at these layers would only influence latency
on the probes that are sent on the load-generating connections.</t>

<t>Below the transport layer many places have a potential queue build-up. It is
important to keep these queues at reasonable sizes or that they implement techniques
like FQ-Codel. Depending on the techniques used at these layers, the queue build-up
can influence latency on probes sent on load-generating connections as well as
separate connections. If flow-queuing is used at these layers, the impact on
separate connections will be negligible.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="network-influence"><name>Network influence</name>

<t>The network obviously is a large driver for the responsiveness result.
Propagation delay from the client to the server as well as queuing in the
bottleneck node will cause latency. Beyond these traditional sources of latency,
other factors may influence the results as well. Many networks deploy transparent
TCP Proxies, firewalls doing deep packet-inspection, HTTP "accelerators",...
As the methodology relies on the use of HTTP/2, the responsiveness metric will
be influenced by such devices as well.</t>

<t>The network will influence both kinds of latency probes that the responsiveness
tests sends out. Depending on the network's use of Smart Queue Management and whether
this includes flow-queuing or not, the latency probes on the load-generating
connections may be influenced differently than the probes on the separate
connections.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="server-side-influence"><name>Server side influence</name>

<t>Finally, the server-side introduces the same kind of influence on the responsiveness
as the client-side, with the difference that the responsiveness will be impacted
during the downlink load generation.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="root-causing-responsiveness"><name>Root-causing Responsiveness</name>

<t>Once a responsiveness result has been generated one might be tempted to try to localize
the source of a potential low responsiveness. The responsiveness measurement
is however aimed at providing a quick, top-level view of the responsiveness
under working conditions the way end-users experience it.
Localizing the source of low responsiveness involves however a set of different
tools and methodologies.</t>

<t>Nevertheless, the Responsiveness Test allows to gain some insight into what the
source of the latency is. The previous section described the elements that influence
the responsiveness. From there it became apparent that the latency measured
on the load-generating connections and the latency measured on separate connections
may be different due to the different elements.</t>

<t>For example, if the latency measured on separate connections is much less than the
latency measured on the load-generating connections, it is possible to narrow
down the source of the additional latency on the load-generating connections.
As long as the other elements of the network don't do flow-queueing, the additional
latency must come from the queue build-up at the HTTP and TCP layer.
This is because all other bottlenecks in the network that may cause a queue build-up
will be affecting the load-generating connections as well as the separate latency
probing connections in the same way.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="responsiveness-test-server-api"><name>Responsiveness Test Server API</name>

<t>The responsiveness measurement is built upon a foundation of standard protocols:
IP, TCP, TLS, HTTP/2.
On top of this foundation, a minimal amount of new “protocol” is defined,
merely specifying the URLs that used for GET and PUT in the process of
executing the test.</t>

<t>Both the client and the server MUST support HTTP/2 over TLS.
The client MUST be able to send a GET request and a POST.
The server MUST be able to respond to both of these
HTTP commands.
The server MUST have the ability to provide content upon a GET request.
The server MUST use a packet scheduling algorithm that minimizes internal queueing
to avoid affecting the client's measurement.</t>

<t>As clients and servers become deployed that use L4S congestion control
(e.g., TCP Prague with ECT(1) packet marking),
for their normal traffic when it is available, and fall back
to traditional loss-based congestion controls (e.g., Reno or CUBIC)
otherwise, the same strategy SHOULD be used for Responsiveness Test traffic.
This is RECOMMENDED so that the synthetic traffic generated
by the Responsiveness Test mimics real-world traffic for that server.</t>

<t>Delay-based congestion-control algorithms (e.g., Vegas, FAST, BBR)
SHOULD NOT be used for Responsiveness Test traffic because they take
much longer to discover the depth of the bottleneck buffers.
Delay-based congestion-control algorithms seek to mitigate the
effects of bufferbloat, by detecting and responding to early signs
of increasing round-trip delay, and reducing the amount of data they
have in flight before the bottleneck buffer fills up and overflows.
In a world where bufferbloat is common, this is a pragmatic
mitigation to allow software to work better in that environment.
However, that approach does not fix the underlying problem of bufferbloat;
it merely avoids it in some cases,
and allows the problem in the network to persist.
For a diagnostic tool made to identify symptoms of bufferbloat in the
network so that they can be fixed, using a transport protocol explicitly
designed to mask those symptoms would be a poor choice, and would
require the test to run for much longer to deliver the same results.</t>

<t>The server MUST respond to 4 URLs:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>A "small" URL/response:
The server must respond with a status code of 200 and 1 byte in the body.
The actual message content is irrelevant.
The server SHOULD specify the content-type as application/octet-stream.
The server SHOULD minimize the size, in bytes, of the response fields that are encoded and sent on the wire.</t>
  <t>A "large" URL/response:
The server must respond with a status code of 200 and a body size of at least 8GB.
The server SHOULD specify the content-type as application/octet-stream.
The body can be bigger, and may need to grow as network speeds increases over time.
The actual message content is irrelevant.
The client will probably never completely download the object,
but will instead close the connection after reaching working condition
and making its measurements.</t>
  <t>An "upload" URL/response:
The server must handle a POST request with an arbitrary body size.
The server should discard the payload.
The actual POST message content is irrelevant.
The client will probably never completely upload the object,
but will instead close the connection after reaching working condition
and making its measurements.</t>
  <t>A .well-known URL <xref target="RFC8615"/> which contains configuration information for 
the client to run the test (See <xref target="discovery"/>, below.)</t>
</list></t>

<t>The client begins the responsiveness measurement by querying for the JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> configuration.
This supplies the URLs for creating the load-generating connections in
the upstream and downstream direction as well as the small object
for the latency measurements.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discovery"><name>Responsiveness Test Server Discovery</name>

<t>It makes sense for a service provider (either an application service provider like a video conferencing service
or a network access provider like an ISP) to host Responsiveness Test Server instances on their
network so customers can determine what to expect about the quality of their connection to 
the service offered by that provider.
However, when a user performs a Responsiveness Test and determines
that they are suffering from poor responsiveness during the connection to that service,
the logical next questions might be,</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>"What’s causing my poor performance?"</t>
  <t>"Is it poor buffer management by my ISP?"</t>
  <t>"Is it poor buffer management in my home Wi-Fi Access point?"</t>
  <t>"Something to do with the service provider?"</t>
  <t>"Something else entirely?”</t>
</list></t>

<t>To help an end user answer these questions, it will be useful for test clients
to be able to easily discover Responsiveness Test Server instances running in various
places in the network (e.g., their home router, their Wi-Fi access point, their ISP's
head-end equipment, etc).</t>

<t>Consider this example scenario: A user has a cable modem
service offering 100 Mb/s download speed, connected via
gigabit Ethernet to one or more Wi-Fi access points in their home,
which then offer service to Wi-Fi client devices at different rates
depending on distance, interference from other traffic, etc.
By having the cable modem itself host a Responsiveness Test Server instance,
the user can then run a test between the cable modem and their computer
or smartphone, to help isolate whether bufferbloat they are experiencing
is occurring in equipment inside the home (like their Wi-Fi access points)
or somewhere outside the home.</t>

<section anchor="well-known-uniform-resource-identifier-uri-for-test-server-discovery"><name>Well-Known Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) For Test Server Discovery</name>

<t>Any organization that wishes to host their own instance of a Responsiveness Test Server can advertise that capability
by hosting at the network quality well-known URI a resource whose content type is application/json and contains a valid JSON object meeting the 
following criteria:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{
  "version": 1,
  "urls": {
    "large_download_url":"https://nq.example.com/api/v1/large",
    "small_download_url":"https://nq.example.com/api/v1/small",
    "upload_url":        "https://nq.example.com/api/v1/upload"
  }
  "test_endpoint": "hostname123.provider.com"
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The server SHALL specify the content-type of the resource at the well-known URI as application/json.</t>

<t>The content of the "version" field SHALL be "1". Integer values greater than "1" are reserved
for future versions of this protocol.
The content of the "large_download_url", "small_download_url", and "upload_url" SHALL
all be validly formatted "http" or "https" URLs. See above for the semantics of the fields.
All of the fields in the sample configuration are required except "test_endpoint".
If the test server provider can pin all of the requests for a test run to a specific
host in the service (for a particular run), they can specify that host name in the
"test_endpoint" field.</t>

<t>For purposes of registration of the well-known URI <xref target="RFC8615"/>, the application name is "nq". The media type
of the resource at the well-known URI is "application/json" and the format of the resource is as specified
above. The URI scheme is "https". No additional path components, query strings or fragments are valid
for this well-known URI.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dns-based-service-discovery-for-test-server-discovery"><name>DNS-Based Service Discovery for Test Server Discovery</name>

<t>To further aid the test client in discovering instances of the Responsiveness Test Server, organizations
wishing to host their own instances of the Test Server MAY advertise their availability using
DNS-Based Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763"/> using conventional, unicast DNS <xref target="RFC1034"/> or multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762"/>
on the organization network's local link(s).</t>

<t>The Responsiveness Test Service instances should advertise using the service type <xref target="RFC6335"/> 
"_nq._tcp".  Population of the appropriate DNS zone with the
relevant unicast discovery records can be performed
automatically using a Discovery Proxy <xref target="RFC8766"/>,
or in some scenarios simply by having a human
administrator manually enter the required records.</t>

<section anchor="example"><name>Example</name>

<t>An obscure service provider hosting a Responsiveness Test Server instance for their
organization (obs.cr) on the "rpm.obs.cr" host would return the following answers
to PTR and SRV conventional DNS queries:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
$ nslookup -q=ptr _nq._tcp.obs.cr.
Non-authoritative answer:
_nq._tcp.obs.crname = rpm._nq._tcp.obs.cr.
$ nslookup -q=srv rpm._nq._tcp.obs.cr.
Non-authoritative answer:
rpm._nq._tcp.obs.crservice = 0 0 443 rpm.obs.cr.
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Given those conventional DNS query responses, the client would proceed to access the rpm.obs.cr
host on port 443 at the .well-known/nq well-known URI to begin the test.</t>
