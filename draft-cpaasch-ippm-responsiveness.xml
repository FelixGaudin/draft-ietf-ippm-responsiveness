    <abstract>


<t>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called
lag, latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized
as an unfortunate, but common symptom in today’s networks.
Even after a decade of work on standardizing technical solutions,
it remains a common problem for the end users.</t>

<t>Everyone “knows” that it is “normal” for a video conference to
have problems when somebody else at home is
watching a 4K movie or uploading photos from their phone.
However, there is no technical reason for this to be the case.
In fact, various queue management solutions (fq_codel, cake, PIE)
have solved the problem for tens of thousands of people.</t>

<t>Our networks remain unresponsive, not from a lack of technical solutions,
but rather a lack of awareness of the problem.
We believe that creating a tool whose measurement matches people’s
every day experience will create the necessary awareness,
and result in a demand for products that solve the problem.</t>

<t>This document specifies the “RPM Test” for measuring responsiveness.
It uses common protocols and mechanisms to measure user
experience especially when the network is fully loaded
(“responsiveness under working conditions”.)
The measurement is expressed as “Round-trips Per Minute” (RPM)
and should be included with throughput (up and down) and
idle latency as critical indicators of network quality.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called
lag, latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized
as an unfortunate, but common symptom in today’s networks <xref target="Bufferbloat"/>.
Solutions like fq_codel <xref target="RFC8290"/> or PIE <xref target="RFC8033"/> have been standardized
and are to some extent widely implemented.
Nevertheless, people still suffer from bufferbloat.</t>

<t>Although significant, the impact on user experience can be transitory -
that is, its effect is not always present.
Whenever a network is actively being used at its full capacity,
buffers can fill up and create latency for traffic.
The duration of those full buffers may be brief:
a medium-sized file transfer, like an email attachment
or uploading photos,
can create bursts of latency spikes.
An example of this is lag occurring during a videoconference,
where a connection is briefly shown as unstable.</t>

<t>These short-lived disruptions make it hard to narrow down the cause.
We believe that it is necessary to create a standardized way to
measure and express responsiveness.</t>

<t>Existing network measurement tools could incorporate a
responsiveness measurement into their set of metrics.
Doing so would also raise the awareness of the problem and
make the standard “network quality measures” of
throughput, idle latency, and responsiveness.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>A word about the term “bufferbloat” - the undesirable latency
that comes from a router or other network equipment
buffering too much data.
This document uses the term as a general description of bad latency,
using more precise wording where warranted.</t>

<t>“Latency” is a poor measure of responsiveness,
since it can be hard for the general public to understand.
The units are unfamiliar (“what is a millisecond?”) and
counterintuitive (“100 msec - that sounds good -
it’s only a tenth of a second!”).</t>

<t>Instead, we create the term “Responsiveness under working conditions”
to make it clear that we are measuring all, not just idle, conditions,
and use “round-trips per minute” as the metric.
The values range from 50 (poor) to 3,000 (excellent),
with the added advantage that “bigger is better.”
Finally, we abbreviate the measurement to “RPM”, a wink to the
“revolutions per minute” that we use for cars.</t>

<t>This document defines an algorithm for the “RPM Test”
that explicitly measures responsiveness under working conditions.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="design-constraints" title="Design Constraints">

<t>There are many challenges around measurements on the Internet.
They include the dynamic nature of the Internet,
the diverse nature of the traffic,
the large number of devices that affect traffic,
and the difficulty of attaining appropriate measurement conditions.</t>

<t>Internet paths are changing all the time.
Daily fluctuations in the demand make the bottlenecks ebb and flow.
To minimize the variability of routing changes,
it’s best to keep the test duration relatively short.</t>

<t>TCP and UDP traffic, or traffic on ports 80 and 443, may take
significantly different paths on the Internet and
be subject to entirely different Quality of Service (QoS) treatment.
A good test will use standard transport layer traffic - typical
for people’s use of the network -
that is subject to the transport’s congestion control that might
reduce the traffic’s rate and thus its buffering in the network.</t>

<t>Traditionally, one thinks of bufferbloat happening on the
routers and switches of the Internet.
However, the networking stacks of the clients and servers can
have huge buffers.
Data sitting in TCP sockets or waiting for the application
to send or read causes artificial latency, and affects user experience
the same way as “traditional” bufferbloat.</t>

<t>Finally, it is important to note that queueing only happens behind
a slow “bottleneck” link in the network,
and only occurs when sufficient traffic is present.
The RPM Test must ensure that buffers are actually full
for a sustained period, and only then make repeated latency
measurements in this particular state.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goals" title="Goals">

<t>The algorithm described here defines an RPM Test that serves as a good
proxy for user experience. This means:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Today’s Internet traffic primarily uses HTTP/2 over TLS.
Thus, the algorithm should use that protocol.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
As a side note: other types of traffic are gaining in popularity (HTTP/3)
and/or are already being used widely (RTP).
Traffic prioritization and QoS rules on the Internet may
subject traffic to completely different paths:<vspace />
these could also be measured separately.</t>
  <t>The Internet is marked by the deployment of countless middleboxes like
transparent TCP proxies or traffic prioritization for certain types of traffic.
The RPM Test must take into account their effect on
DNS-request <xref target="RFC1035"/>, TCP-handshake <xref target="RFC0793"/>, TLS-handshake, and request/response.</t>
  <t>The test result should be expressed in an intuitive, nontechnical form.</t>
  <t>Finally, to be useful to a wide audience, the measurement
should finish within a short time frame.
Our target is 20 seconds.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="measuring-responsiveness-under-working-conditions" title="Measuring Responsiveness Under Working Conditions">

<t>To make an accurate measurement,
the algorithm must reliably put the network in a state
that represents those “working conditions”.
Once the network has reached that state,
the algorithm can measure its responsiveness.
The following explains how
the former and the latter are achieved.</t>

<section anchor="working-conditions" title="Working Conditions">

<t>For the purpose of this methodology, typical “working conditions” represent a
state of the network in which the bottleneck node is experiencing ingress and
egress flows similar to those created by humans in the typical
day-to-day pattern.</t>

<t>While a single HTTP transaction might briefly put a network into
working conditions, making reliable measurements
requires maintaining the state over sufficient time.</t>

<t>The algorithm must also detect when the network is in a
persistent working condition, also called “saturation”.</t>

<t>Desired properties of “working condition”:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Should not waste traffic, because the person may be paying for it.</t>
  <t>Should finish within a short time to
avoid impacting other people on the same network,
to avoid varying network conditions, and not try the person’s patience.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="from-single-flow-to-multi-flow" title="From single-flow to multi-flow">

<t>A single TCP connection may not be sufficient to saturate a path.
For example, the 4MB constraints on TCP window size constraints
may not fill the pipe.
Additionally, traditional loss-based TCP congestion control algorithms
react aggressively to packet loss by reducing the congestion window.
This reaction (intended by the protocol design) decreases the
queueing within the network, making it hard to reach saturation.</t>

<t>The goal of the RPM Test is to keep the network as busy as possible
in a sustained and persistent way.
It uses multiple TCP connections and gradually adds more TCP flows
until saturation is reached.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="parallel-vs-sequential-uplink-and-downlink" title="Parallel vs Sequential Uplink and Downlink">

<t>Poor responsiveness can be caused by queues in either (or both)
the upstream and the downstream direction.
Furthermore, both paths may differ significantly due to access link
conditions (e.g., 5G downstream and LTE upstream) or the routing changes
within the ISPs.
To measure responsiveness under working conditions,
the algorithm must saturate both directions.</t>

<t>Measuring in parallel achieves more data samples for a given duration.
Given the desired test duration of 20 seconds,
sequential uplink and downlink tests would only yield half the data.
The RPM Test specifies parallel, concurrent measurements.</t>

<t>However, a number of caveats come with measuring in parallel:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Half-duplex links may not permit simultaneous uplink and downlink traffic.
This means the test might not saturate both directions at once.</t>
  <t>Debuggability of the results becomes harder:
During parallel measurement it is impossible to differentiate whether
the observed latency happens in the uplink or the downlink direction.</t>
  <t>Consequently, the test should have an option for sequential testing.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="reaching-saturation" title="Reaching saturation">

<t>The RPM Test gradually increases the number of TCP connections
and measures “goodput” - the sum of actual data transferred
across all connections in a unit of time.
When the goodput stops increasing, it means that saturation has been
reached.</t>

<t>Saturation has two criteria:
a) the load bearing connections are utilizing all the
capacity of the bottleneck,
b) the buffers in the bottleneck are completely filled.</t>

<t>The algorithm notes that throughput gradually increases until TCP
connections complete their TCP slow-start phase.
At that point, throughput eventually stalls
usually due to receive window limitations.
The only means to further increase throughput is by
adding more TCP connections to the pool of load bearing connections.
If new connections leave the throughput the same,
saturation has been reached and - more importantly -
the working condition is stable.</t>

<t>Filling buffers at the bottleneck depends on the congestion control
deployed on the sender side.
Congestion control algorithms like BBR may reach high throughput
without causing queueing because the bandwidth detection
portion of BBR effectively seeks the bottleneck capacity.</t>

<t>RPM Test clients and servers should use loss-based congestion controls
like Cubic to fill queues reliably.</t>

<t>The RPM Test detects saturation when the observed goodput is not increasing
even as connections are being added,
or it detects packet loss or ECN marks signaling
congestion or a full buffer of the bottleneck link.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="final-working-conditions-algorithm" title="Final “Working Conditions” Algorithm">

<t>The following algorithm reaches working conditions (saturation) of a network
by using HTTP/2 upload (POST) or download (GET) requests of infinitely large
files.
The algorithm is the same for upload and download and uses
the same term “load bearing connection” for each.</t>

<t>The steps of the algorithm are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Create 4 load bearing connections</t>
  <t>At each 1 second interval:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Compute “instantaneous aggregate” goodput which is the number of bytes
transferred within the last second.</t>
      <t>Compute a moving average of the last 4 “instantaneous aggregate goodput” measurements</t>
      <t>If moving average &gt; “previous” moving average + 5%:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Network did not yet reach saturation.
If no flows added within the last 4 seconds, add 4 more flows</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>Else, network reached saturation for the current flow count.
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>If new flows added and for 4 seconds the moving average throughput
did not change: network reached stable saturation</t>
          <t>Else, add four more flows</t>
        </list></t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>Note: It is tempting to envision an initial base round-trip time (RTT)
measurement and adjust the intervals as a function of that RTT.
However,
experiments have shown that this makes the saturation detection extremely
unstable in low RTT environments.
In the situation where the “unloaded” RTT is in the
single-digit millisecond range, yet the network’s RTT increases under load
to more than a hundred milliseconds, the intervals become much too low to
accurately drive the algorithm.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="measuring-responsiveness" title="Measuring Responsiveness">

<t>Once the network is in a consistent working conditions,
the RPM Test must “probe” the network multiple times
to measure its responsiveness.</t>

<t>Each RPM Test probe measures:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>The responsiveness of the different steps to create a new connection,
all during working conditions.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
To do this, the test measures the time needed to make a DNS request,
establish a TCP connection on port 443,
establish a TLS context using TLS1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/>, and
send and receive a one-byte object with a HTTP/2 GET request.
It repeats these steps multiple times for accuracy.</t>
  <t>The responsiveness of the network and the client/server networking stacks
for the load bearing connections themselves.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
To do this, the load bearing connections multiplex an HTTP/2 GET
request for a one-byte object to get the end-to-end latency on the
connections that are using the network at full speed.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="aggregating-the-measurements" title="Aggregating the Measurements">

<t>The algorithm produces sets of 5 times for each probe, namely:
DNS handshake, TCP handshake, TLS handshake, HTTP/2 request/response on
separate (idle) connections, HTTP/2 request/response on load bearing connections.
This fine-grained data is useful, but not necessary for creating a useful metric.</t>

<t>To create a single “Responsiveness” (e.g., RPM) number,
this first iteration of the algorithm gives
an equal weight to each of these values.
That is, it sums the five time values for each probe,
and divides by the total number of probes to compute
an average probe duration.
The reciprocal of this, normalized to 60 seconds,
gives the Round-trips Per Minute (RPM).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="statistical-confidence" title="Statistical Confidence">

<t>The number of probes necessary for statistical confidence
is an open question.
One could imagine a computation of the variance and confidence interval
that would drive the number of measurements and balance the accuracy
with the speed of the measurement itself.</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="rpm-test-server-api" title="RPM Test Server API">

<t>The RPM measurement uses standard protocols:
no new protocol is defined.</t>

<t>Both the client and the server MUST support HTTP/2 over TLS 1.3.
The client MUST be able to send a GET request and a POST.
The server MUST be able to respond to both of these
HTTP commands.
Further, the server endpoint MUST be accessible through a hostname
that can be resolved through DNS.
The server MUST have the ability to provide content upon a GET request.
Both client and server SHOULD use loss-based congestion controls
like Cubic.
The server MUST use a packet scheduling algorithm that minimizes internal queueing
to avoid affecting the client’s measurement.</t>

<t>The server MUST respond to 4 URLs:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>A “small” URL/response:
The server must respond with a status code of 200 and 1 byte in the body.
The actual body content is irrelevant.</t>
  <t>A “large” URL/response:
The server must respond with a status code of 200 and a body size of at least 8GB.
The body can be bigger, and may need to grow as network speeds increases over time.
The actual body content is irrelevant.
The client will probably never completely download the object,
but will instead close the connection after reaching working condition
and making its measurements.</t>
  <t>An “upload” URL/response:
The server must handle a POST request with an arbitrary body size.
The server should discard the payload.</t>
  <t>A configuration URL that returns a JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> object with the information
the client uses to run the test (sample below).
Sample JSON:  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{
  "version": 1,
  "urls": {
    "small_https_download_url": "https://networkquality.example.com/api/v1/small",
    "large_https_download_url": "https://networkquality.example.com/api/v1/large",
    "https_upload_url": "https://networkquality.example.com/api/v1/upload"
  }
}
]]></artwork></figure>
  </t>
</list></t>

<t>The client begins the responsiveness measurement by querying for the JSON configuration.
This supplies the URLs for creating the load bearing connections in
the upstream and downstream direction as well as the small object
for the latency measurements.</t>

<abstract><t>Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation.  As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance.  There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.</t><t>This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called &quot;PIE&quot; (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value.
